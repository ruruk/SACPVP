The frustrations that many of you have experienced hopefully will be an event of the past.\n\nAs the incoming Registrar it has taken some time to assess the problem areas. A critical appraisal was indeed required and after analysing and evaluating the current system, there was no other choice but to transition from a very manual based operation to now a more systematised one.\n\nWe are therefore pleased to share an exciting update from our recent meeting with the service providers appointed.\n\nLater this year, we will transition from physical registration cards to modern, secure e-Certificates and e-Registration cards. This change will make your registration process more convenient, secure, and eco-friendly.\n\nWhat's Coming?\n\n• e-Certificate: A digital document (PDF) confirming your registration status, which you can download or share with clients and authorities.\n• e-Registration Card: A digital ID card accessible via a mobile app or web portal, ideal for quick verification.\n• Both will feature QR codes for instant authenticity checks and advanced security measures like encryption.\n\nWhy Are We Making This Change?\n• Convenience: Access your credentials anytime, anywhere, without the risk of losing a physical card.\n• Security: Digital credentials are harder to forge and easier to verify.\n• Sustainability: Eliminates paper and plastic use.\n• Global Standards: Aligns with worldwide trends in digital professional credentials.\n\nWhat About Your Current Registration?\n• For those RPs who have received your current physical registration card, it remains valid until the new system launches later this year.\n• For the majority who have paid for registration unlike previous years, you will not be receiving your physical card as usual.\n• Many valuation companies and government organisations have created access cards or proof of being a registered Valuer.\n• Going forward, we will notify you well in advance with details on how to access your e-Certificate and e-Registration card once the system is ready. We anticipate well before the year end.\n\nWhat is Next?\n• We are working on a secure online portal and mobile app for easy access to your credentials.\n• When the system is ready, you'll receive an email with login instructions and access details.\n• Guides and support will be available on our website, and our helpdesk will assist you.\n\nWhat about CPD functionality?\n• You will have the ability to update the CPD point/s submission for approval\n• Upload the CPD documentation\n• Recording of annual CPD activity\n• CPD audit reviews reminders\n\nWe are committed to making this transition smooth and will keep you updated.\n\nWill there be Online registration?\n• Online registration form process will be available to members based on their profile and document requirements per member type\n\nThere will be many more functionalities and exciting news to share in the months ahead.\n\nThank you for your support as we are moving toward a more efficient and secure registration process and service.\n\nKind Regards",
